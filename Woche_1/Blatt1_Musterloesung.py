    # --------- 1. Grayscale Transformation ----------
    # reads in the image as a numpy array
    an_image=plt.imread("Woche_1/test.jpg")

    # weights for each color channel [r,g,b]
    # adjusting the weights to their edge cases
    # will result in removing / giving each color channel more weight towards the gray value
    # all 0 would mean a black image, all 1 would give each color the same weight,
    # meaning there would be more defined, sharp edges
    # The image would also be a lot lighter (since we overflow the maximum gray value in most cases
    # depending on the picture)
    weights=[0.2989,0.5870,0.1140]

    # performs the dot product on each color channel
    # [...,:3] selects all rows and columns,
    # but only the first 3 color channels (ignoring possibly existing alpha channel)
    # the dot product cominbes all color channels into one grayscale channel
    # (the result is a 2d array)
    # [r,g,b]*[a,b,c] = a * r + b * g + c * b = gray
    grayscaleimage=np.dot(an_image[...,:3],weights)

    # paints the image on the plot, but defines that the np-array is now 2-dimensional (grayscale)
    show_img(grayscaleimage, 'gray')

    # --------- 2. Color Interpolation ----------

    # the most defining difference is, that rgb has three (or four) channels for each color value
    # while HSV has one channel for the color (H = Hue), and two for saturation and lightness (S = Saturation, V = Value)
    # This means, we can interpolate between two colors by interpolating between the Hue values
    # while keeping the saturation and lightness constant.

    # In RGB in order to interpolate correctly, we need to convert the colors to CIE XYZ space
    # and then interpolate between the X, Y and Z values.
    # To convert between RGB and CIE XYZ, we can choose a number of conversion matricies.
    # In this example, the "Best RGB" from http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_RGB_XYZ_Matrix.html
    # is chosen.
    # Afterwards, we need to convert the result back to RGB space.
    # This will result in a different, but more "bland" output than using the HSV interpolation.

    # In HSV, we will get more colors in between (such as cyan blue in this example), since the Hue
    # value is already an "interpolation" in the color wheel
    # Although it is important to note, that we can interpolate in two directions (directly and indirectly with wrap around from 0 to 1)
    # Therefore, we need to check which distance is shortest and choose it.

    # In practice, when interpolating between colors, you generally choose HSV, as it is less complex to implement and outputs nice colors.
    # For a highly adjustable interpolation, better performance and more work, choose RGB.

    # define two colors to interpolate between
